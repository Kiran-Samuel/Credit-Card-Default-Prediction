# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

# Description

- The project deals with predicting credit card defaulters in a bank by using different machine learning models like Logisitic regression, Decision tree, Ada Boost, KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes 
- Deploying the best model as an API using FastAPI. 
- At the end of the training and testing phase, it was found that SVM had the highest prediction accuracy among the machine learning models

# Code
- The entire classification project can be be tested using the **Project1 Code.ipynb** file 

# For credit card default prediction
- Make sure to download the 2 pickled files: **svc_model.pkl** and **scaling.pkl** and then run **credit_app.ipynb** and proceed to the API for prediction

# Deployment files
- svc_model.pkl
- scaling.pkl
- credit_app.ipynb
